# MSc Thesis – Predicting Future Healthcare Demands in Ireland

This repository contains all datasets, code, outputs, and LaTeX project files used for my MSc final thesis titled:

**"Predicting Future Healthcare Demands in Ireland: A Demographic Data-Driven Modelling Approach"**

## 📄 Thesis Overview
The thesis focuses on forecasting healthcare demand for diabetes-related hospitalisations in Ireland using statistical models (ARIMA, SARIMA) and machine learning models (XGBoost, Random Forest). The study integrates demographic data from the Central Statistics Office (CSO) Ireland and hospital utilisation data from the Health Service Executive (HSE).

## 📂 Repository Structure
- **`Datasets.zip`** – Contains raw and processed datasets used for analysis (sourced from CSO and HSE).
- **`Final_code.ipynb`** – Jupyter Notebook containing the full data preprocessing, modelling, and visualisation workflow.
- **`Outputs.zip`** – Model results, visualisations, and generated tables.
- **`Thesis_latex_project_zip`** – Complete LaTeX project files for the final thesis document.

## ⚙️ Requirements
To run the code, install the following Python libraries:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn xgboost statsmodels
